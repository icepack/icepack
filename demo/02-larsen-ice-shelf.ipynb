    "This demo will involve using real data for the Larsen Ice Shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula.\n",
    "The use of real data will mostly change how we set up the simulation.\n",
    "The simulation itself -- involving successive prognostic and diagnostic solves of the physics model -- is virtually identical to what we saw in the last demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the data, you'll need to have a login for [EarthData](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/), the web portal through which NASA makes remote sensing data available to the public.\n",
    "Most of the ice sheet remote sensing data produced by American research institutions is hosted at the [National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)](https://www.nsidc.org) and an EarthData login is necessary to access data from NSIDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The external data that we will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an ice thickness map from the [bedmap2](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/bedmap-2/) data set, which is available from the British Antarctic Survey\n",
    "* a velocity map of Antarctica produced as part of the MEaSUREs program, which you can read more about [here](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0484)\n",
    "* a satellite image of all of Antarctica taken from [MODIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Resolution_Imaging_Spectroradiometer)\n",
    "* an outline of the Larsen C Ice Shelf, which I created by tracing over this satellite image in a [geographic information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than manually download these data sets from the websites they're hosted on, we'll call a few functions in the module `data.py` in this directory to fetch them for us.\n",
    "(Internally, these functions use a library called [pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch) which handles things like caching the data so it doesn't get downloaded twice, unzipping archived files, and so forth.)\n",
    "One we have these data sets we'll use the library [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to read the gridded data and [GeoJSON](https://github.com/jazzband/python-geojson) for the vector data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last demo, we showed how to simulate ice shelf flow using synthetic data.\n",
    "Here we showed how to load in a generated mesh and observational data, and we used this same functionality to simulate a real ice shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real data sets require some amount of preprocessing before they can be used for modeling.\n",
    "For example, many velocity data sets have missing pixels or patches due to noise in the optical or radar imagery, and these missing points have to be filled in somehow.\n",
    "The Bedmap2 thickness also contains processing artifacts that are visible as depressions running diagonally across the ice shelf.\n",
    "These artifacts could be removed by using a low-pass filter on the gridded data, although this might also wash out some real features like the many rifts in the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the simulation, we had to come up with a guess for the ice rheology.\n",
    "The simple choice we made is quite far from the real value and in a subsequent demo we'll show how to estimate it from observational data."
