    "Icepack uses the functions in firedrake to implement solvers for the various physics problems that show up in ice sheet modeling.\n",

    "They can also be used to define input fields of simulations, if those fields have a simple analytical expression.\n",
    "In the next demo, we'll show how to use icepack to solve for the velocity and thickness of a floating ice shelf with a synthetic geometry.\n",
