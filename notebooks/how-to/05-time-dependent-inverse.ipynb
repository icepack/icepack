    "# Time-dependent data assimilation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** the code demonstrated in this notebook is experimental.\n",
    "Use it at your own risk.\n",
    "We had to tweak solver choices and settings in order to make it work.\n",
    "If you try to build off of it and something breaks, please [get in touch](https://icepack.github.io/contact/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate some more of the capabilities that icepack has for assimilating observational data.\n",
    "In a previous demo, we showed how to estimate a parameter in an ice model (the fluidity) from remote sensing observations.\n",
    "To do so, we had to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the loss functional, or how we measure the agreement of our computed state with observations\n",
    "2. the regularization functional, or how unusual or complex our guess for these parameters were, and\n",
    "3. the simulation, or what the physics is that relates the parameters and the observable fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous demo, the governing physics was the momentum conservation equation of ice flow, which is time-independent.\n",
    "Here we'll look at how to use more involved simulations, including both mass and momentum conservation, that relate the unknown and the observable fields.\n",
    "The resulting simulation now depends on time.\n",
    "This is possible thanks to the adjoint capabilities in Firedrake and it looks pretty similar to the simpler time-dependent case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than try to estimate an unobservable parameter as we did in the previous demo, we'll focus here on estimating the value of an initial condition from measurements of the glacier at a later time.\n",
    "In principle, you can do joint estimation of both state and parameters at once; as far as the code is concerned, there's no distinction between the two.\n",
    "We've stuck to a pure state estimation problem here just to keep things simple."

    "Rather than do a cold start every time, we'll instead load up a previously-computed steady state from checkpoint files if they're available.\n",
    "(See the [how-to guide](https://icepack.github.io/notebooks/how-to/02-checkpointing/) on checkpointing.)\n",
    "If not, we'll do an initial spin-up for 3600 years using a cheaper degree-1 finite element basis and then a final spin-up using a degree-2 basis."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous demos, we've shown how use measurements of observable fields, like ice velocity and thickness, to estimate unknown parameters that satisfy constraints from a physics model.\n",
    "The physics model was fairly rudimentary before -- taking in a single field like the ice fluidity and returning the ice velocity as computed from the momentum conservation equation.\n",
    "Here we showed how to use much more complex simulations involving a full timestepping loop.\n",
    "Instead of estimating an unobservable parameter of the system, like the fluidity or friction coefficient, we instead showed how to estimate the thickness at a different time from when it was observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these kinds of problems is more computationally expensive and finding better or faster algorithms is an active area of research.\n",
    "While costly, the capability does open up many more possible research directions and improvements on existing practice.\n",
    "For example, when estimating the ice fluidity or friction, it's common to assume that the thickness and velocity measurements were taken at the same time.\n",
    "This assumption is almost never exactly true.\n",
    "The ability to do time-dependent data assimilation means that we can dispense with it."
