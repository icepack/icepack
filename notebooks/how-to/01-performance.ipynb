    "Making choices about solution methods is often a tradeoff between robustness and speed.\n",
    "For this simulation, we had to use the more robust but slower solver in icepack for the first 900 years of the spin-up because the equivalent line search solvers in PETSc would fail.\n",
    "(They would actually work fine on some machines but fail on others, because computing is hard.)\n",
    "The trust region method from PETSc does work for the first 900 simulation years as well, but can be slower on more reasonable inputs.\n",
    "If you are interested in tuning performance, **you should expect to use multiple solution methods in the same simulation**, especially if the system can meander through multiple regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've focused here on how to get the most performance out of a single simulation at a fixed resolution.\n",
    "Things get much more interesting when we need to get an accurate result and are free to increase the resolution as need be.\n",
    "For these types of problems, a lot of the work can be done at coarser resolution and knowing exactly how much is both an art and a science."
