    "The results we obtained from assimilating the point data directly were mostly similar to those we obtained from interpolating them to the finite element mesh.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of assimilating sparse point data directly is that we can be more rigorous about the statistical interpretation of our results.\n",
    "If we assume that the observational data are normally distributed about the true velocity values with mean 0 and with standard deviation as reported in the remote sensing product, then the sum of squared errors is a $\\chi^2$ random variable with $N - M$ degrees of freedom, where $N$ is the number of observation points and $M$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the parameters we're fitting."

    "By using the point data directly, we know exactly what $N$ is, which isn't true at all when we're comparing to a velocity that's been interpolated to a mesh that could have a more or less arbitrary and variable resolution.\n",
    "We still have the problem of determining the number $M$ of degrees of freedom, which is a little more involved because of the regularization; we have to read it off from the trace of the posterior covariance matrix.\n",
    "That's outside the scope of this tutorial, but we could also have, for example, used a few eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator as a fixed set of basis functions with no regularization instead.\n",
    "In any case, using the raw data gets us closer to a statistical exactitude.\n",
    "If we can't fit our model to observations as well as we expect, that suggests either that we've mis-characterized the statistical properties of the observations or that our model is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key advantage was not apparent in this notebook but does show up in other applications.\n",
    "Here we used a gridded data product with fairly dense coverage over the domain of interest.\n",
    "Other data sources are genuinely sparse, for example laser altimetry measurements from ICESat-2, radar sounding from Operation IceBridge flights, or even strain gauge or thermometry data from isolated boreholes."
