    "Saving simulation results is useful in several circumstances when you have long-running or expensive models.\n",
    "You can experiment with post-processing or visualization by working with the saved simulation results rather than have to run it again every time you tweak the colorbar.\n",

    "For this demo, we'll look at a more complex scenario where different solvers are called for in different stages of the model run.\n",
    "Serializing the results lets you experiment with the numerics in each stage separately.\n",
    "The melt phase of the MISMIP+ experiment requires a pretty fine spatial resolution.\n",
    "We could just start the experiment cold with a very fine mesh.\n",
    "But we'd only be burning a lot of CPU cycles computing very accurate approximations to intermediate states that we'll only toss out anyway.\n",
    "Instead, we can spin the model up at coarse resolution for several thousand years to propagate out most of the transients and save the results to disk.\n",
    "We can then resume from that checkpoint, interpolate the results to a function space with more degrees of freedom, and then complete the rest of the spin-up.\n",
    "This is a fairly typical workflow if you have to do expensive simulations."

    "This is handy for educational purposes, but it might not be an ideal workflow if you're doing big expensive simulations.\n",
    "For that use case, it can be more conevenient for you to use one script for the simulation that saves the results to an HDF5 file at the end and do all the post-processing, analysis, and visualization in a notebook or in another script.\n",
    "As we've shown here, you might understand one part of a multi-stage simulation but still be debugging the numerics for a latter stage, and checkpointing the earlier stage is useful for saving time as well.\n",
    "Tools like [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be really handy for orchestrating these kinds of processing pipelines."
