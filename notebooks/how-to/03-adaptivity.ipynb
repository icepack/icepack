    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that we've shown above demonstrates how to refine the mesh according to criteria of your choosing.\n",
    "We used an interface to Triangle through the package MeshPy to do that, but first we had to do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimate the errors.**\n",
    "We used the discrepancy in thickness between a lower and a higher-order finite element basis as a proxy for the true error, which we cannot know.\n",
    "2. **Decide how much to refine the mesh and where.**\n",
    "We came up with a completely arbitrary area scaling formula through trial and error.\n",
    "It happened to work ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are alternative approaches for each of these steps.\n",
    "Another common method for error estimation is to measure the *gradient reconstruction* error.\n",
    "If we used, say, a continuous piecewise quadratic basis for the thickness, its gradient would be a discontinuous field.\n",
    "The idea of gradient reconstruction is to project the discontinuous, exact value of the gradient field back onto the basis CG(2) that we used in the first place.\n",
    "The discrepancy between the exact gradient and the reconstruction tells us something about the error.\n",
    "This is only one approach and there are many more ways to do *a posteriori error estimation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a more informed decision about where to refine the mesh, we can try to equally distribute the error according to the estimate we've already obtained above.\n",
    "We could also have guessed that we'll need lots of triangles near the glacier grounding line before we went to solve anything.\n",
    "In that case, we're using specific domain knowledge about the problem rather than a posteriori error estimates.\n",
    "This is also a good idea and you can always use a posteriori error estimates to guide further refinements.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more scientific way to approach a posteriori error estimation and mesh refinement based on finding the derivative of a certain *goal functional* -- which plays a similar role to the objective functional in an inverse problem -- with respect to the state variables.\n",
    "If you want to learn more, the book by [Bangerth and Rannacher](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-0348-7605-6) is a great reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we used only a single cycle of simulate, estimate, refine, simulate again.\n",
    "You can of course repeat the loop more than once to add further refinement levels.\n",
    "You can also apply the same principles to decide how to adapatively choose the timestep -- rather than use a single time integration loop, run a low-res simulation with timestep $\\delta t$ and a high-res one with timestep $\\delta t / 2$.\n",
    "The approach we've shown here is pretty rudimentary and leaves a lot up to you.\n",
    "Using these ideas can be a huge help in solving practical problems, but it requires a lot of experimentation."
