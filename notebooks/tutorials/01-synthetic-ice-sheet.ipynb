    "In the last demo, we saw how to create a mesh, define a finite element space, interpolate functions to that finite element space, and analyze the results.\n",
    "Here we've shown how to use these functions as an input to an ice sheet using the shallow ice flow model.\n",
    "If you want to experiment with this example a bit more, you can run this notebook yourself and:\n",
    "\n",
    "* change the mass balance parameters\n",
    "* change the depth of the bedrock valleys or height of the ridge\n",
    "* change the initial ice sheet geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass balance parameters are in units of meters/year.\n",
    "A typical accumulation rate deep in the interior of Antarctica would be on the order of 7 cm/year, whereas southeast Greenland can have rates closer to 50 cm / year to 1.5 m / year.\n",
    "You can learn more about the mass balance of glaciers around the world from the [SUMup](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/10/1959/2018/) database.\n",
    "To make things even more interesting, you can try changing the accumulation rate or lapse rate as a function of time to simulate glacial cycles."
