    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll revisit the Larsen Ice Shelf.\n",
    "This time, we're going to estimate the fluidity coefficient $A$ in Glen's flow law\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot\\varepsilon = A\\tau^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "from observational data.\n",
    "In the previous demos, we've come up with some value of the fluidity coefficient and computed a velocity field by solving an elliptic partial differential equation.\n",
    "The fluidity coefficient is roughly a known function of the ice temperature, together with some fudge factors for crystal fabric or large-scale damage, so we know an approximate range of values that it could take.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we don't have large-scale measurements of the fluidity coefficient from remote sensing like we do for ice velocity and thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can try to come up with a value of $A$ that gives a velocity field closest to what we observed.\n",
    "This idea can be turned into a constrained optimization problem.\n",
    "The quantity we wish to optimize is the misfit between the computed velocity $u$ and the observed velocity $u^o$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_\\Omega\\left(\\frac{u - u^o}{\\sigma}\\right)^2dx,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ are the standard deviations of the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "One constraint is that the fluidity field has to be positive.\n",
    "Inequality constraints can require substantially more sophisticated numerical methods.\n",
    "To avoid this problem, we'll cheat our way out by reparameterizing $A$ in terms of a new variable $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = A_0e^\\theta.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the value of $\\theta$, $A$ is always positive.\n",
    "To make this change, we'll give the `IceShelf` object our own custom-made function for calculating the viscous part of the action functional, just like we did for the friction in the last demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to minimizing the misfit, we also want to have a relatively smooth value of the parameter field $\\theta$.\n",
    "The regularization functional $R$ is included to penalize oscillations of size $\\Theta$ over a given length scale $L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R(\\theta) = \\frac{L^2}{2\\Theta^2}\\int_\\Omega|\\nabla \\theta|^2dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let $F(u, \\theta)$ be the weak form of the shallow shelf equations, again using the new parameter $\\theta$ instead of the fluidity $A$.\n",
    "The physics constraint for our problem is that $F(u, \\theta) = 0$.\n",
    "We can enforce this constraint by introducing the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, in which case the combined objective functional is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(u, \\theta; \\lambda) = E(u) + R(\\theta) + \\langle F(u, \\theta), \\lambda\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the derivative of this functional with respect to $\\theta$ by using the *adjoint method*.\n",
    "We can then use a descent method to iterate towards a critical point, which is hopefully close to the true value of the fluidity coefficient."

    "In this demo, we've shown how to back out the fluidity of an ice shelf from remote sensing observations.\n",
    "We could then use this value, together with a description of how the fluidity evolves, to initialize a prognostic model of the ice shelf.\n",
    "For example, we might assume that the fluidity is a function of ice temperature and damage.\n",
    "The evolution equations for these fields are fairly simple hyperbolic PDE for which we can write solvers using firedrake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the fluidity that we obtained is not at all spatially homogeneous.\n",
    "Unless we were very clever, we probably couldn't have come up with some way to parameterize it to get a reasonable guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect from statistical estimation theory that the value of the misfit functional divided by the shelf area will be around 1.\n",
    "(A sum of squares of normal random variables has a $\\chi^2$ distribution, which has mean 1, there are two components of the velocity vector, and we divide by 2 at the end.)\n",
    "The misfit we obtained once the algorithm has converged is much larger than 1.\n",
    "Why might this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We made a poor choice of regularization parameter; the solution is too smooth to fit the data.\n",
    "2. The regularization parameter is fine, but the error estimates $\\sigma$ are wrong.\n",
    "3. The standard deviations $\\sigma$ of the error estimates are correct, but the error distribution is non-normal and has heavier tails.\n",
    "4. We don't have a good way to also account for thickness errors, which are substantial.\n",
    "5. The ice shelf is actually grounded on some isolated pinning points or ice rises and we didn't add any basal drag.\n",
    "6. The model physics don't adequately account for the effects of rifts and crevasses.\n",
    "7. The numerical optimization algorithm is implemented incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure modes 1 happens because we don't have the right prior distribution, while modes 2, 3, and 4 occur because we don't have the correct observational likelihood.\n",
    "Modes 5 and 6 are more insidious types of failure.\n",
    "In this case, the physics model doesn't actually describe the true behavior of the system.\n",
    "This might mean that the model cannot reproduce the observations with *any* value of the input data.\n",
    "That kind of failure is difficult to miss.\n",
    "But some wrong physics models -- those that are [controllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllability) as a function of the input parameters -- might still be able to reproduce the observations.\n",
    "The catch is that they will \"explain\" the data however they can, even if the reasons are wrong!\n",
    "Diagnosing this type of failure is arguably the most difficult.\n",
    "Last but not least is human error in implementing the optimization algorithms.\n",
    "These kinds of failures should be caught through testing on synthetic problems."
