    "\n",
    "Icepack uses the functions in firedrake to implement solvers for the various physics problems that show up in ice sheet modeling.\n",
    "The firedrake routines that we've demonstrated here can be used for analyzing simulation results, either through visualization, evaluating fields at points, or evaluating integrals of fields.\n",
    "They can also be used to define input fields of simulations, if those fields have a simple analytical expression.\n",
    "In the next demo, we'll show how to use icepack to solve for the velocity and thickness of a floating ice shelf with a synthetic geometry.\n",
    "In later demos, we'll show how to use real observational data sets, as well as more complicated geometries imported from mesh generators.\n",
