    "We already have a mesh, and we need to decide what element family and polynomial degree.\n",

    "The function `firedrake.SpatialCoordinate` returns two symbolic objects `x`, `y` for the coordinates of each point of the mesh.\n",
    "We can then use these symbols to define expressions for the function we'd like to analyze.\n",
    "In this case, I've chosen the [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function).\n",
    "Firedrake has built-in functions for evaluating various transcendental functions of the coordinates, for example the sine, cosine, exponential, logarithm, etc.\n",
    "To see all of the available functions, you can check the namespace `ufl.operators`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function `firedrake.interpolate` takes in an expression and a function space, and returns a field from that function space.\n",
    "In the code below, the variable `expr` is a purely symbolic object.\n",
    "The variable `q` on the other hand represents what happens when that expression gets interpolated to some function space.\n",
    "The space we've chosen can represent polynomials up to degree 2 within each triangle, whereas the expression we're interpolating has polynomials up to degree four.\n",
    "So there can be some loss of precision when we interpolate an expression to a function space."

    "Icepack uses the functions in Firedrake to implement solvers for the various physics problems that show up in ice sheet modeling.\n",

    "They can also be used to define input fields of simulations, if those fields have a simple analytical expression.\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll show how to use icepack to solve for the velocity and thickness of a an ice sheet with a synthetic geometry.\n",
