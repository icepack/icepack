    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll show how to simulate the evolution of a floating ice shelf.\n",
    "The example that we'll show is an example of a model *spin-up*.\n",
    "In a spin-up experiment, the objective is to obtain a physically plausible state of some system from an initial guess by simulating its evolution for a long time.\n",
    "For example, it's common to spin up climate models from a very rough initial guess for several thousand years to obtain a representative state of the atmosphere and oceans for the epoch you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll use an idealized ice shelf geometry and a rough guess for the initial ice thickness.\n",
    "First we'll solve the *diagnostic equation* for the velocity througout the ice shelf.\n",
    "We'll then solve the *prognostic equation* to obtain the ice thickness at a slightly later time.\n",
    "By assuming a given rate of ice accumulation and melting, we can successively solve the prognostic and diagnostic equations until the system is close to a steady state.\n",
    "In our case, that will take about 250 years of model time and (at least on my laptop) only a few minutes of computer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the synthetic ice sheet demo, the whole simulation can be divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the shape of the ice shelf and get a triangulation of the interior.\n",
    "* Define the initial guess for the ice thickness and velocity, and set a value of the rheology and accumulation rate.\n",
    "* Set the total simulation time and the number of time steps, and then iteratively update the ice thickness and velocity at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw this workflow in the last demo. In later demos we'll see some variations on this procedure -- incorporating real data, comparing different physics, and so forth -- but the essential idea is the same throughout."
