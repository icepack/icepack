    "One exception to this was in the Larsen C notebook.\n",
    "The remote sensing data that we used for the thickness were finely resolved to capture individual rifts, which look like discontinuities.\n",

    "No amount of fiddling with the solver can fix this error.\n",
    "3. Add `\"snes_monitor\": None` to the solver options.\n",

    "6. Try all the possible line search methods.\n",
    "7. Try using the Newton trust region method.\n",
    "8. If all of these fail, [get in touch](https://icepack.github.io/contact/) with the complete script and data and output from SNES monitor.\n",

    "In an ideal world, the solvers would all work perfectly the first time and you wouldn't need to know any of this.\n",
    "We strive to make icepack as robust as it can be through both good defaults and careful problem formulation.\n",
    "But you might still need some of the strategies outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial diagnostic solve to compute the starting velocity is usually the most challenging.\n",
    "Provided that the timestep is not too large, the changes to the thickness should be small enough that the velocity from the previous timestep will be a good guess for the velocity at the next timestep.\n",
    "When solving statistical estimation problems, on the other hand, the outer-level optimization solver can make weird or unphysical guesses for the parameters, which can then crash the inner-level physics solver.\n",
    "Knowing how to get more information from PETSc using `\"snes_monitor\"` is crucial to debugging these types of problems."
